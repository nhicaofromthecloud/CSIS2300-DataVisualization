# CSIS2300-DataVisualization
If Vancouver Regional District 's visible minorities were 100 people ...

Target audience: Vancouver residents 

Message: The city's multiculturalism adds colorful richness to its cultural, social, and economic fabric, making it a vibrant and exciting place to live. Residents can be proud of this diversity and celebrate the unique qualities that each community brings to the city.

More succinct message: Diversity is beautiful. 


My process: I obtained the data from statcan and then used python to scale the dataset to 100 to make it easier for my audience to digest the data. In my visualization, I used a Tree map chart instead of the typical commonly used pie chart so that even the 1% population is represented. I used free stock graphic elements from Canva to decorate my chart, making it look more lively and culturally interesting.
